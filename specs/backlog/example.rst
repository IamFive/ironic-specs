==========================================
This is a sample to test rendering only
==========================================

This is only a sample. It tests the rendering of templates in the backlog.

Problem description
===================

There is not a clear way for reviewers to know that short specs are being
rendered properly without a sample.

This sample can be deleted once any real spec file is added to the backlog
dir. Or, alternately, it can remain here.

Proposed change
===============

Add this sample. That's all that needs to be done.
