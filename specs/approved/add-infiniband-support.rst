======================
Add InfiniBand Support
======================

https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic/+bug/1532534

Today, Ironic supports Ethernet interfaces for Hardware inspection and
PXE boot. Ironic should have the ability to inspect and PXE boot over
InfiniBand network as well.


Problem description
===================

* Hardware inspection for InfiniBand - A InfiniBand GUID is similar in concept
  to a MAC address because it consists of a 24-bit manufacturerâ€™s prefix and
  a 40-bit device identifier (64 bits total).

* PXE Boot over InfiniBand - To allow DHCP over IPoIB interface the DHCP client
  must send the client-id with a unique identifying value for the
  client. The value is consist of the vendor prefix 12 bytes and GUID 8 bytes.
  Today ironic doesn't send update the neutron port with client-id option.

Proposed change
===============

* Hardware inspection for InfiniBand -  In order to use InfiniBand with PXE
  you have to flash the NIC with a vendor specific firmware. The vendor
  firmware defined the conversion of GUID to "InfiniBand MAC" (48 bits).
  To resource complicity of the change, the ironic address will contain the
  "InfiniBand MAC".

* PXE/iPXE Boot over InfiniBand changes:
  To allow DHCP over InfiniBand we need the following:

  1. The dhcp-server must use the BROADCAST flag in the dhcp-server.
     This already support in neutron-dhcp-agent by config file.

  #. Updating the ironic port extra attribute to contains the InfiniBand
     port client-id extra e.g::

        {
            'client-id':
            'ff:00:00:00:00:00:02:00:00:02:c9:00:00:02:c9:03:00:00:10:39'
        }

     The client-id update can be done manually or with IPA and
     ironic-inspector.

  #. The neutron port that represent the ironic port should be updated
     with client-id option in the extra_dhcp_opts attribute.
     The client-id consists of a vendor prefix and the port GUID.
     The client id for Mellanox ConnectX Family Devices is
     consists of a prefix (ff:00:00:00:00:00:02:00:00:02:c9:00) and
     8 byte port GUID. The prefix in the client-id is vendor specific.

  #. The PXE MAC file name consists of the <Hardware Type>-<MAC>.
     For InfiniBand the hardware Type is 20 and the mac is the
     InfiniBand truncate GUID.

  #. The iPXE MAC file name consists of the <MAC>.
     For InfiniBand the MAC is the InfiniBand truncate GUID.

Other projects changes:

   * ironic-python-agent changes:

     1. Update the ironic agent to calculate the InfiniBand truncate GUID
        and the Client ID.
     #. Update coreos  and tinyipa with ib_ipoib driver.

   * ironic-inspector changes:

     1. Update the ironic-inspector to update port.extra with client-id

   * diskimage-builder changes:

     1. Update the mellanox element to load ib_ipoib driver.

Alternatives
------------

* Extend the ironic port to support GUID which is 8 bytes and
  calculate the client-id in the ironic code from the GUID.
  This will require updating the ironic model and API.
  This will require updating the nova ironic driver to truncate
  the GUID to MAC.
