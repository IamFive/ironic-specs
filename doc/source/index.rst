Ironic Project Specifications
=============================

This serves as a reference for approved specs within the current, and each
prior, development cycle. Specs begin life in the "approved" tree, and once
implemented, are moved to the "implemented" tree for that development cycle.
At the end of a cycle, specs which were partially implemented should remain
in the "approved" tree, only moving to "implemented" when the work is
completely done. Additionally, a "backlog" of ideas is maintained to indicate
the agreed-upon goals for the project which have no specific work being done
on them at this time.
