Ironic Project Specifications
=============================

This serves as a reference for approved specs within the current, and each
prior, release cycle. At the end of a cycle, specs which were approved but not
implemented at all will be deleted and should be re-proposed. Specs which were
partly implemented will be modified to indicate such, and a continuation spec
should be proposed for the new cycle. Additionally, a "backlog" of ideas is
maintained to indicate the agreed-upon goals for the project which have no
specific work being done on them at this time.
